# Ops Module

This directory contains internal operations code that supports the feature interpreter package. It appears to maintain a nested copy of the feature interpreter module infrastructure, possibly for supporting operations such as:

1. Legacy code support
2. Internal utility functions
3. Development or testing versions of pipeline functionality

The nested structure suggests this may be used for development or specialized operations that aren't part of the main public API.

## Structure

The directory contains a nested structure that mirrors parts of the main feature_interpreter package:

- `feature_interpreter/pipeline/`: Contains an empty `__init__.py` file, likely as a placeholder for pipeline functionality.

## Usage

This module is primarily for internal use and is not documented as part of the main public API. Users should generally use the top-level feature_interpreter API functions rather than accessing this nested functionality directly.
