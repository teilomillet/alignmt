# Research Methodology: Reasoning Capability Analysis

This document outlines our research methodology for analyzing reasoning capabilities in language models at the feature level.

## Research Question

We are investigating a focused question:

**How do reasoning capabilities differ between language models at the feature level, and what specific reasoning patterns show the most significant differences?**

Rather than broadly studying all capabilities, we deliberately focus on reasoning—a critical component of language model intelligence.

## Theoretical Framework

Our research builds on the hypothesis that reasoning in language models emerges from specific neural activation patterns:

1. Different reasoning types (deductive, abductive, etc.) correspond to distinct activation patterns
2. These patterns can be identified by comparing models on reasoning-focused tasks
3. Advanced reasoning capabilities manifest as distinctive activation signatures

## Two Complementary Approaches

Our methodology combines two powerful techniques that work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of reasoning features.

### 1. The Crosscoder Approach

The crosscoder approach maps corresponding components between models based on function rather than position. It:

- Creates parameter-level mappings between models using cosine similarity
- Identifies which parameters serve similar functions despite architectural differences
- Determines whether differences represent fundamental changes or merely scaling
- Provides a structural foundation for validating causal relationships

### 2. Feature Interpretation

Feature interpretation identifies specific neurons and patterns activated during reasoning tasks. It:

- Examines which neurons activate differently when models process reasoning prompts
- Extracts consistent patterns across multiple prompts in the same reasoning category
- Interprets what these activation differences represent functionally
- Tests whether identified features correlate with measurable performance differences

## How Crosscoder and Feature Interpretation Converge

These two approaches are not just complementary—they fundamentally need each other to provide meaningful insights:

### Why Feature Interpretation Needs Crosscoder

Feature interpretation identifies neurons that activate differently during reasoning tasks, but cannot determine if these differences are causal or coincidental. Crosscoder helps by:

- Providing a structural mapping between model components
- Validating that identified features align with parameter-level differences
- Strengthening causal claims about which neural features are responsible for reasoning differences

Without crosscoder validation, we might identify many correlation-based differences without knowing which ones actually cause reasoning capability changes.

### Why Crosscoder Needs Feature Interpretation

Crosscoder provides parameter-level mapping but doesn't indicate which parameter differences actually matter for reasoning. Feature interpretation fills this gap by:

- Focusing on specific reasoning tasks through carefully designed prompts
- Identifying which neurons and patterns show meaningful activation differences
- Connecting parameter differences to observable model behavior

Without feature interpretation, crosscoder would identify parameter differences without understanding their functional significance.

## Implementation through the Integrated Pipeline

Our methodology is implemented through an integrated pipeline that:

1. Runs crosscoder analysis to establish component correspondence between models
2. Extracts activations from both models using reasoning-focused prompts
3. Identifies features with significant activation differences
4. Validates features using crosscoder results to establish causal relationships
5. Tests features with specialized capability testing to verify functional impact
6. Generates visualizations and reports highlighting key reasoning-related features

This approach combines structural analysis (crosscoder) with functional analysis (feature interpretation) to provide stronger evidence than either method alone.

## Specialized Components for Reasoning Analysis

Two key modules support our reasoning-focused approach:

### The @naming Module

This module interprets what identified features actually represent:

- Analyzes patterns in model outputs when features are activated
- Identifies primary characteristic patterns associated with each feature
- Generates textual descriptions explaining what each feature represents
- Validates these interpretations against crosscoder results

### The @capability Module

This module verifies whether identified features cause measurable performance differences:

- Generates contrastive examples designed to test specific reasoning capabilities
- Evaluates model performance on these targeted examples
- Calculates quantitative metrics measuring feature impact
- Verifies that identified features correspond to meaningful capability differences

## Focused Prompt Design

We use specialized prompt categories to probe different aspects of reasoning:

- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Mathematical problem-solving requiring precise steps
- **Chain of Thought**: Complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning
- **Formal Logic**: Syllogisms, implications, and logical deduction
- **Causal Reasoning**: Distinguishing correlation from causation
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Statistical thinking and probability concepts
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Hypothetical "what if" scenarios
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Knowledge transfer between domains
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Generating explanatory hypotheses
- **Adversarial Reasoning**: Avoiding cognitive traps and biases
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Handling multiple interacting constraints

## Advantages of This Approach

Our focused methodology offers several key advantages:

1. **Deeper analysis**: By focusing on reasoning, we can detect subtle differences that broader analyses would miss
2. **Clearer interpretation**: Limited scope allows for more precise feature interpretation
3. **Causality, not just correlation**: The integration of crosscoder with feature interpretation strengthens causal evidence
4. **Practical application**: Findings directly apply to selecting models for reasoning-intensive tasks
5. **Scientific rigor**: A focused question enables more systematic analysis and stronger conclusions

## Guidelines for Interpreting Results

When analyzing results from this methodology, consider:

1. **Feature specificity**: Features relate specifically to reasoning, not general performance
2. **Pattern variation**: Look for differences across reasoning types (e.g., strong in logic but weak in probabilistic reasoning)
3. **Layer distribution**: Note which layers show significant differences, as reasoning capabilities may localize in specific network regions
4. **Validation strength**: Higher crosscoder validation scores indicate stronger causal evidence
5. **Capability impact**: Check whether feature differences correlate with measurable performance differences

## Working Hypotheses and What to Test Next

Based on our framework, we propose several testable hypotheses:

1. **Layer Specificity Hypothesis**: Reasoning capabilities concentrate in specific transformer layers rather than distributing evenly throughout the model
   - **Next test**: Analyze layer-by-layer activation patterns across different reasoning categories
   - **Expected finding**: Significant feature clusters in middle-to-late layers

2. **Parameter Type Hypothesis**: Reasoning features will concentrate in specific parameter types, particularly MLP gate projections
   - **Next test**: Compare feature distribution across different parameter types
   - **Expected finding**: Higher concentration of validated reasoning features in gate_proj.weight parameters

3. **Reasoning Integration Hypothesis**: Advanced reasoning emerges from integrating multiple reasoning types rather than excelling in any single type
   - **Next test**: Analyze correlations between performance across reasoning categories
   - **Expected finding**: Strong correlations between improvements in different reasoning categories

4. **Emergent Feature Hypothesis**: Sophisticated reasoning relies on distributed patterns rather than isolated neurons
   - **Next test**: Compare single-neuron vs. multi-neuron feature effectiveness
   - **Expected finding**: Multi-neuron features showing stronger correlation with complex reasoning tasks

## How to Gather Evidence for These Hypotheses

To generate evidence for these hypotheses, we recommend the following experiments:

1. **Layer-specific analysis**
   - Run the integrated pipeline with layer-specific output collection
   - Generate layer contribution heatmaps for each reasoning category
   - Compare layer activations across different reasoning types
   - **Expected insights**: Identification of "reasoning-specialized" layers

2. **Parameter-type comparison**
   - Modify the crosscoder_param_types configuration to include multiple parameter types
   - Compare feature validation rates across different parameter types
   - Analyze which parameter types show the strongest reasoning-related differences
   - **Expected insights**: Understanding which parameter types encode reasoning capabilities

3. **Cross-category correlation analysis**
   - Calculate performance metrics for each reasoning category
   - Generate correlation matrices between categories
   - Identify clusters of correlated reasoning capabilities
   - **Expected insights**: Understanding whether reasoning capabilities develop independently or in clusters

4. **Single vs. distributed feature analysis**
   - Modify the feature extraction process to identify both single-neuron and multi-neuron features
   - Compare capability testing results between the two feature types
   - Measure impact on performance when intervening on different feature types
   - **Expected insights**: Understanding whether reasoning emerges from individual neurons or distributed patterns

## Limitations

While powerful, our approach has limitations to consider:

1. **Domain specificity**: Focuses on reasoning, potentially missing other important model differences
2. **Prompt sensitivity**: Results may vary based on prompt phrasing
3. **Architectural dependency**: Interpretation may differ across model architectures
4. **Validation challenges**: Even with both approaches, establishing true causality remains difficult

## Conclusion

By combining crosscoder structural analysis with feature interpretation functional analysis, we create a methodology that provides deeper insights into reasoning capabilities than either approach alone. This integration enables us to make stronger causal claims about which neural features are responsible for reasoning differences between language models, ultimately advancing our understanding of how reasoning emerges in these complex systems.
