## Conclusion

This report provides a feature-level interpretation of the differences between the models. 
The identified features highlight the distinctive capabilities of each model and can guide further investigation.

## Causal Feature Validation

The following analysis shows the causal importance of identified features, measured through activation patching experiments.
This helps determine whether the features are actually responsible for the observed behavioral differences.

### Base Model Feature Impact

These features from the base model were validated by patching experiments:

| Feature | Layer | Impact Score | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| human_experience capability | model.layers.15 | 0.91 | Very high causal impact |


### Target Model Feature Impact

These features from the target model were validated by patching experiments:

| Feature | Layer | Impact Score | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| structured reasoning | model.layers.14 | 0.87 | Very high causal impact |
| precise instruction following | model.layers.14 | 0.94 | Very high causal impact |
| precise knowledge | model.layers.13 | 0.93 | Very high causal impact |
| structured generation | model.layers.8 | 0.94 | Very high causal impact |
| systematic coding | model.layers.15 | 0.94 | Very high causal impact |
| spontaneity capability | model.layers.27 | 0.95 | Very high causal impact |
| divergent_thinking capability | model.layers.14 | 0.93 | Very high causal impact |
| metaphorical_thinking capability | model.layers.15 | 0.90 | Very high causal impact |
| ethical_reasoning capability | model.layers.9 | 0.94 | Very high causal impact |
| human_experience capability | model.layers.15 | 0.91 | Very high causal impact |
| impossible_questions capability | model.layers.12 | 0.93 | Very high causal impact |


The impact score represents how much model behavior changes when a feature is patched from one model to another.
Higher scores indicate that the feature is causally important for the model's behavior.
